# React Learning Basic Router Project

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates the usage of React Router for client-side routing in a single-page application.

## Project Overview

The React Learning Basic Router project showcases the following features:

- Multiple pages with client-side routing
- Navigation menu for easy page navigation
- Dynamic rendering of components based on route changes
- Route parameters for displaying specific content based on URL
- Linking between pages using React Router's `<Link>` component

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Joulence/react-course-learning-router
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd react-course-learning-router
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore the different pages and navigate through them using the navigation menu.

The main components of the application are:

- `Home`: The landing page of the application.
- `Products`: A page that displays a list of products.
- `ProductDetails`: A page that shows detailed information about a specific product. The product ID is passed as a route parameter.
- `Error`: A fallback page that is displayed when a user navigates to a non-existent route.

Feel free to modify the existing components or create new ones to further enhance your learning experience.
